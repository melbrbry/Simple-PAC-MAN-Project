# Activity Recognition based on features of objects detected

In this project, I develop two main approaches to solve a simple custom (developed from scratch) version of Pac-Man Atari game.
First, I introduce a linear function approximation based solution with hand-coded features using three different learning algorithms:
Q-learning, SARSA and Monte Carlo. Second, I introduce a neural network based solution with 2 different variations the second one uses 
more robust input/output representation and utilizes CNNs. 

## Getting Started

You need to clone the reporistory to your local machine. Run this command in your terminal where you like to clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/melbrbry/Simple-PAC-MAN-Project
```

### Prerequisites

Required packages:  
numpy  
keras 

## Acknowledgement
- This project is done as part of the final project for the second module of the Artificial Intelligence course 
taught by prof. Luca Iocchi - Sapienza Universit√† di Roma.
